    publish_rate: 1.0  # Hz - how often to check for new data and publish/batch
    
    # Batch Mode Settings
    enable_batch_mode: true  # true = batch uploads, false = real-time streaming
    batch_size: 10  # Number of samples to accumulate before sending batch
    
    # Note: Batch mode is more efficient for bandwidth and reduces API calls.
    # Real-time mode provides lower latency but increases network traffic.
